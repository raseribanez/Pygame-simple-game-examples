# Pygame-simple-game-examples
a collection of games and examples - mostly One-Script files

APOLOGIES

I have 2 very similar repo's one was intended to be tutorial based - with some basics and simple demos
 The other was intended to contain somelow level one-script games. You may see some of the same things in
 both repositories, please bare with me, over time I will reorganize everything - or just put it
 all in to one Pygame Basics repo
